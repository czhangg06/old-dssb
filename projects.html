                        <p>This semester, Data Science Society at Berkeley will be partnering with FairVote, "a non-partisan, 501(c)(3)h non-profit organization that seeks to make democracy fair, functional, and more representative." Many of our tasks will depend on our collective skill set, but, broadly speaking, we aim to find ways to educate the public about reforms that make our democracy mathematically sane in a way that is accessible, transparent, and engaging. Possible projects include an interactive website comparing instant runoff voting, the leading alternative to first past the post, to the current system as well as other proposed alternatives like score voting, approval voting, and quadratic voting. If you think our democracy is broken and you want to use your data science skills for social good this semester, this is the project for you. </p>

                        <p>Prey capture in zebrafish is an innate behavior where sensory information (mostly visual) is transformed into a motor output. Every capture is a stereotyped sequence of movements and starts with an eye convergence (increase of depth perception by increasing the angle between eyes. The zebrafish model allows for whole-field imaging brain activity through the transparent head of the larva and to manipulate brain activity through optogenetics, and is therefore a good model to explore the circuit behind the decision to capture prey. Tasks for the project will be:

                        <p>The student leader is working with the Mental Health Crisis Team in the city of Berkeley to answer some questions around mental health crises, i.e. those that require emergency response, in Berkeley. Eventually, we would like to move to broader questions, e.g., looking for patterns across cities of the Bay Area. Preliminary results showed that there are patterns of when mental health crisis occur and there may be patterns of crises with socioeconomic status. While these results are unsurprising, they are useful to the team for better allocating resources and can lead to policy changes. </p>

                        This project is exciting because it has the potential for real-world relatively “immediate” impact. However, it is challenging in the amount of creativity it requires to ask interesting questions with seemingly unrelated, small datasets. This project is also centered around real datasets, which are obviously messy. A good undergraduate match will be interested in learning new tools and working with municipal employees to improve mental health crisis response. The majority of work is tracking down datasets, visualizing those datasets, and communicating findings.

                        <p>A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation. Over time, chatbots have become more sophisticated. Call the earliest version of a chatbot Version 0 (V0). Call the next version of that chatbot V1. And so on. The difference between Vn and Vn+1 could be various things, including, but not limited to, additional features, bug fixes, personality, and knowledge.

                        The goal of this project is to construct a function that maps Vn and Vn+1 to a number that quantifies their differences. Was there a minor bug fix or did the new version add tons of new capabilities? Such a function will contribute to metrics at Google. </p>

                        <p>'WikiReading' is a dataset introduced by Google last month designed to extract facts from Wikipedia articles. Each of the 18.58 million entries contains a Wikipedia document, a property and a value. The task is to automatically read through the document while conditioning on the property, in order to extract the correct value. However, the skewed distribution of propoerties makes predicting the rare properties quite hard. However, we would expect that, for instance, the patterns associated with the "place of birth" and "date of birth" properties would be similar. And an idea to tackle this problem is to use deep learning architectures that could improve fact extraction accuracy by allowing these relationships to be reflected in the learned model.

                        <p> Next spring, DS 100 will be a new upper division course directly following DATA 8 and its associated connector courses. It is a transitional course between lower DS/CS and upper CS/Stats with the goal of giving students real, hands-on projects that reflects real world challenges. The prerequisites to this course are: DS8/CS61A and MATH54. It is recommended to have also taken at least one connector course.</p>
                        <p>
                        The DS 100 organizers are looking for students interested in contributing to the development of this course and who:
                        1) Have taken 186, 188 and/or 189 before, and earned A- or above
                        2) Are willing to commit a lot, and stay to become the TAs in the Spring
                        3) Have prior industrial experience (not required but great to have)
                        5) Will contribute to the design of projects, and design a few HWs
                        6) Be available to meet once a week.

                            This fall we will be developing a new course called Data–X.  It is a project course at the intersection of CS Tools, Math Models, and Real Life Problems for undergraduate and masters level students.
                            We believe the course can potentially bring some difficult math concepts to life and also make them understandable. The course is also complementary with the SCET Innovation Collider.</p>
                        <p>
                            If you have background in CS tools and would like to help in the development of this course, in addition to submitting a brief statement of interest, please send your resume to <a href="mailto:dss.berkeley@gmail.com?Subject=[Resume]%20-%20Data-X" target="_top">dss.berkeley@gmail.com</a>.

                            We are recruiting for 2-3 students to work on the project over fall.  Work study eligibility is preferred.</p>
